What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	A git repository can be created with 'git init' command. In the current
	directory will be created e '.git' directory that, in some OSes, will be
	hidden beacuse of dot character as prefix. In the .git directory there are
	metadata files that are used by git to maintain history of files and repository
	changes in general. Initialy git doesn't create a first commit and that
	will be issued by the programmer passing a explicative message.
